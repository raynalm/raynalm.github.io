I am currently a Phd student working as a reasearch engineer at:
+ [Nokia - Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/) in the mathematics department under the direction of [Marc-Olivier Buob](http://marcolivier.buob.pagesperso-orange.fr/) and [Élie de Panafieu](https://www.lincs.fr/people/elie-de-panafieu/)
+ [LIG - Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble](http://www.liglab.fr/): [MRIM team](http://lig-mrim.imag.fr/) under the direction of [Georges Quénot](http://lig-membres.imag.fr/quenot/)

My subject is 'Space-Time Pattern Matching & Interpretable Machine Learning'. The purpose is to develop new algorithms and tools, mainly in the field of pattern matching and language theory, in order to shed some light on machine learning processes by making them more interpretable.  

My main topics of interest are:
+ Machine Learning
+ Operations Reseach
+ Theory of Languages
+ Theory of Graphs & Combinatorics

I also love juggling, which I've been practicing for the last 25 years.
